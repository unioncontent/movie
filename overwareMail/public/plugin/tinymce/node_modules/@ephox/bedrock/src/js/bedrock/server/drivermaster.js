  /*
   * DriverMaster is a very naive locking / unlocking system for access
   * to the webdriver. The goal of it is to overcome the situation where
   * the IEDriver begins to interleave executeScript requests, and gets
   * the responses out of order (causing a lot of fragility)
   *
   * The basic approach is this:
   * - a state variable called inUse. This is set to true only while
   *   there is a process currently locking the webdriver
   * - a state variable called queue. This is an *ordered* list of which
   *   processes have requested access to the webdriver
   *
   * The only outside API is waitForIdle which takes the process and a label
   * (for debugging). It will return a promise. That promise will include either
   * a lock, or waiting for a lock. Locks will be granted immediately when:
   *
   * - the queue is empty and there is no current lock
   * - the requester has the same identifier as the head of the queue, and there is no
   *   current lock
   * - some number of attempts to gain access have failed. This situation is basically
   *   just there because I know there will be bugs in releasing the lock.
   *
   * The process will need to wait a while and try again for a lock when:
   *
   * - the queue is not empty and the head of the queue does not match the process
   *   identifier
   *
   * In this way, the queue is designed to allow processes to gain lock access in the
   * order they requested it. If they can't gain access, they stay at the head of the
   * queue and try again later. Something which is not at the head of a non-empty queue
   * should not be able to gain a lock before the head of the queue. This is to prevent
   * a process fortuitously constantly getting the lock because of how the delays
   * fall out.
